# PyBlade Directives

## If statements

PyBlade provides a set of intuitive and developer-friendly directives for conditional statements, allowing you to control the flow of your templates easily. These conditionals work similarly to Python’s `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements, making it simple to render content based on certain conditions.

### Using `@if`, `@elif`, and `@else`

To create conditional statements in PyBlade, use the `@if` directive followed by `@elif` and `@else` as needed. This structure is useful for checking various conditions and displaying content accordingly.

#### Example

Suppose you have a variable `status` that can hold values like `'active'`, `'pending'`, or `'inactive'`. You can display different messages based on the value of `status` using conditional statements:

```python
# In your Django view
def show_status(request):
    context = {'status': 'active'}
    return render(request, 'status.html', context)
```

```html
<!-- In status.pyblade -->
@if (status == 'active')
    <p>Your account is active.</p>
@elif (status == 'pending')
    <p>Your account is pending approval.</p>
@else
    <p>Your account is inactive.</p>
@endif
```

### Output

If `status` is `'active'`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Your account is active.</p>
```

If `status` is `'pending'`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Your account is pending approval.</p>
```

And if `status` is anything else, the output will be:

```html
<p>Your account is inactive.</p>
```

:::info
In PyBlade, you can use the `@if` directive alone, pair it with `@else`, or chain one condition with `@elif`, just like in Python. Do not forget to end your conditional statement with the `@endif` directive.
:::

:::warning
Multiple condition chaning with `@elif` are not supported yet.
:::

### Using `@unless`

The `@unless` directive works as a negation of `@if`. It executes the block only if the condition evaluates to `False`. This is useful for cases where you want to check if a variable does **not** meet a specific condition.

#### Example

If you want to display a message when a user does not have admin privileges:

```python
# In your Django view
def check_admin(request):
    context = {'is_admin': False}
    return render(request, 'admin_check', context)
```

```html
<!-- In admin_check.pyblade -->
@unless (is_admin)
    <p>You do not have admin privileges.</p>
@endunless
```

#### Output

If `is_admin` is `False`, the output will be:

```html
<p>You do not have admin privileges.</p>
```

If `is_admin` is `True`, nothing will be displayed.

### Nested Conditionals

You can also nest conditionals to create more complex logic. However, be cautious with excessive nesting as it can make the template harder to read and maintain.

#### Example

```html
@if (user.is_authenticated)
    @if (user.is_admin)
        <p>Welcome, Admin {{ user.name }}!</p>
    @else
        <p>Welcome, {{ user.name }}!</p>
    @endif
@else
    <p>Please log in to continue.</p>
@endif
```

#### Output

If `user.is_authenticated` is `True` and `user.is_admin` is `True`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Welcome, Admin {{ user.name }}!</p>
```

If `user.is_authenticated` is `True` but `user.is_admin` is `False`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Welcome, {{ user.name }}!</p>
```

And if `user.is_authenticated` is `False`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Please log in to continue.</p>
```

In PyBlade, you can also use logical expressions such as `and`, `or`, and `not` within conditional statements, similar to Python. This allows you to combine multiple conditions in a single directive for more complex checks.

:::warning Warning: Keep logic out of templates
For performance and readability, avoid complex or time-consuming logic within conditional statements. Templates should primarily focus on displaying pre-processed data, not performing heavy logic. Keep calculations and condition checks within views or controllers wherever possible to adhere to the principle of "Logic in the code, templates are for display only."
:::




## Switch statements

PyBlade also provides support for `@switch` statements, which are useful for handling multiple conditions based on the value of a single variable. This can help simplify templates by reducing the need for multiple `@if`, `@elif`, and `@else` statements.

With `@switch`, you can check a variable's value and define multiple `@case` conditions. If none of the cases match, an optional `@default` can be specified as a fallback.

### Basic Syntax

The `@switch` directive takes a variable as its argument. Within the `@switch` block, each condition is checked using `@case`, and the code in the matching `@case` block will execute. If no cases match, the `@default` block will execute (if it is provided).

```html
@switch(variable)
    @case('value1')
        <!-- Code to display if variable == 'value1' -->
    @case('value2')
        <!-- Code to display if variable == 'value2' -->
    @default
        <!-- Code to display if none of the cases match -->
@endswitch
```

### Example

Suppose you have a variable `status` with possible values like `'active'`, `'pending'`, `'inactive'`, or others. You can use `@switch` to display different messages based on `status`:

```python
# In your Django view
def show_status(request):
    context = {'status': 'pending'}
    return render(request, 'status.html', context)
```

```html
<!-- In status.html -->
@switch(status)
    @case('active')
        <p>Your account is active.</p>
    @case('pending')
        <p>Your account is pending approval.</p>
    @case('inactive')
        <p>Your account is inactive.</p>
    @default
        <p>Status unknown.</p>
@endswitch
```

#### Output

If `status` is `'pending'`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Your account is pending approval.</p>
```

If `status` has a value other than `'active'`, `'pending'`, or `'inactive'`, the output will be:

```html
<p>Status unknown.</p>
```

### Nested `@switch` Statements

Just like other conditional structures, `@switch` statements can be nested, though it’s best to keep templates as simple as possible to maintain readability.


## Loops

PyBlade supports looping through lists, dictionaries, and other iterable data structures using the `@for` directive. These loops are similar to Python’s `for` loops and make it easy to display repeated elements in your templates.


### `@for` loop example

If you have a list of items, you can use `@for` to loop through them:

```python
# In your Django view
def show_items(request):
    context = {'fruits': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry']}
    return render(request, 'my_app.index', context)
```

```html
<!-- In items.html -->
<ul>
    @for (fruit in fruits)
        <li>{{ fruit }}</li>
    @endfor
</ul>
```

#### Output

```html
<ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Banana</li>
    <li>Cherry</li>
</ul>
```



### The `@empty` directive

Somethimes, you may need to handle cases where a loop has no items to iterate over. That's why PyBlade provides an `@empty` directive that specifies a fallback to display content if the list or iterable is empty.

```python
# In your Django view
def show_fruits(request):
    context = {'fruits': []}  # An empty list of fruits
    return render(request, 'fruits.html', context)
```

```html
<!-- In fruits.pyblade -->
<ul>
    @for(fruit in fruits)
        <li>{{ fruit }}</li>
    @empty
        <li>No fruits available.</li>
    @endfor
</ul>
```

### Output

```html
<ul>
    <li>No fruits available.</li>
</ul>
```

Using `@empty` ensures that the template provides meaningful feedback in cases where a list or iterable is empty, improving user experience.

### Using the `loop` Variable

In addition, PyBlade provides a special `loop` variable inside each loop, giving you helpful information about the current iteration. This variable allows you to access details like the current index, whether it’s the first or last iteration, and more.

Here is a full list of available properties on the loop variable.


| Property         | Description|
| -------------    | ---------- |
| `loop.index`     | The index of the current loop iteration (starts at 0).|
| `loop.iteration` | The current loop iteration (starts at 1).|
| `loop.first`     | Whether this is the first iteration through the loop.|
| `loop.last`      | Whether this is the last iteration through the loop.|
| `loop.count`     | The total number of items in the iterable being iterated.|
| `loop.remaining` | The iterations remaining in the loop.|
| `loop.even`      | Whether this is an even iteration through the loop.|
| `loop.odd`       | Whether this is an odd iteration through the loop.|


#### Example with `loop` Variable

Let’s enhance the previous example to use the `loop` variable for displaying additional information about each item:

```html
<!-- In items.html -->
<ul>
    @for(fruit in fruits)
        <li>
            @if(loop.first)
                First item:
            @elif(loop.last)
                Last item:
            @else
                Item {{ loop.iteration }} of {{ loop.count }}:
            @endif
            {{ item }}
        </li>
    @endfor
</ul>
```

#### Output

```html
<ul>
    <li>First item: Apple</li>
    <li>Item 2 of 3: Banana</li>
    <li>Last item: Cherry</li>
</ul>
```


### Skipping and ending loop iterations

In PyBlade, you can use the `@continue` directive to skip the current iteration and move on to the next one, or the `@break` directive to exit the loop entirely based on a condition.

#### Example with `@continue` and `@break`

Suppose you have a list of fruits, and you want to display each fruit's name but want to skip "Banana" and stop the loop entirely once you reach "Date."

```python
# In your Django view
def show_fruits(request):
    context = {'fruits': ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry', 'Date', 'Elderberry']}
    return render(request, 'fruits', context)
```

```html
<!-- In fruits.html -->
<ul>
    @for(fruit in fruits)
        @if(fruit == 'Banana')
            @continue
        @endif

        <li>{{ fruit }}</li>

        @if(fruit == 'Date')
            @break
        @endif
    @endfor
</ul>
```

#### Output

```html
<ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li>Cherry</li>
</ul>
```

In this example:
- The `@continue` directive skips the iteration for "Banana," so "Banana" does not appear in the list.
- The `@break` directive stops the loop entirely when it reaches "Date," so "Elderberry" is not displayed.

### Simplified `@continue` and `@break` with Conditions

You can also include the condition directly within the `@continue` and `@break` directives to make your code more concise.

```html
<ul>
    @for fruit in fruits
        @continue(fruit == 'Banana')
        <li>{{ fruit }}</li>
        @break(fruit == 'Date')
    @endfor
</ul>
```

This has the same output as the previous example. By including the condition directly within the `@continue` and `@break` directives, you make the code shorter and clearer.



## Conditional Classes

The `@class` directive in PyBlade lets you conditionally apply CSS classes based on specific conditions. It accepts a dictionary where `keys` represent the class names and `values` are booleans or boolean expressions. If an expression evaluates to `True`, the associated class is applied.

#### Example

In this example, we apply the `list-item` class to each item and `favorite` class to items marked as a favorite:

```python
# In your Django view
def show_fruits(request):
    context = {
        'fruits': [
            {'name': 'Apple', 'is_favorite': True},
            {'name': 'Banana', 'is_favorite': False},
            {'name': 'Cherry', 'is_favorite': True},
        ]
    }
    return render(request, 'fruits.html', context)
```

```html
<!-- In fruits.html -->
<ul>
    @for fruit in fruits
        <li @class({"list-item": True, "favorite": fruit.is_favorite})>{{ fruit.name }}</li>
    @endfor
</ul>
```

### Output

```html
<ul>
    <li class="list-item favorite">Apple</li>
    <li class="list-item">Banana</li>
    <li class="list-item favorite">Cherry</li>
</ul>
```

## Inline Styles

The `@style` directive works similarly to `@class`, but it controls inline CSS styles. It also takes a dictionary where keys are CSS properties, and values are booleans or expressions. When an expression evaluates to `True`, the associated style is applied to the element.

#### Example

Here, we set a red color for fruits that are not favorites:

```html
<ul>
    @for(fruit in fruits)
        <li @style({"color: red;": not fruit.is_favorite})>{{ fruit.name }}</li>
    @endfor
</ul>
```

#### Output

```html
<ul>
    <li>Apple</li>
    <li style="color: red;">Banana</li>
    <li>Cherry</li>
</ul>
```
